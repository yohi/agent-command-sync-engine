# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agent Command Sync Engine is a centralized system for unifying custom command management across multiple AI agent CLIs (ClaudeCode, Codex, GeminiCLI). This solution addresses the critical problem of command fragmentation where developers must redundantly define the same commands for different agents, each with incompatible formats and syntax. By establishing a universal source format and automated transformation pipeline, this system eliminates duplication, reduces cognitive load, and ensures consistency across all AI development tools while supporting third-party framework integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Command Definition and Storage
**Objective:** As a multi-agent developer, I want to define commands once in a universal format that can be automatically adapted for all AI agents, so that I avoid redundant command definitions and maintain consistency across tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new command definition in the central repository THEN the Sync Engine SHALL store it in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter containing metadata fields (name, description, scope, arguments, shell_execution).

2. IF a command file lacks required YAML frontmatter fields (name, description) THEN the Sync Engine SHALL reject the command with a descriptive error message identifying the missing fields.

3. WHERE commands are organized in nested directories within the central repository THE Sync Engine SHALL preserve the directory structure as namespaces for command organization.

4. WHEN a developer modifies an existing command in the central repository THEN the Sync Engine SHALL track the modification timestamp and version for change management.

5. IF duplicate command names exist within the same namespace THEN the Sync Engine SHALL report a conflict error and prevent synchronization until resolved.

### Requirement 2: Agent-Specific Format Transformation
**Objective:** As a developer using multiple AI agents, I want the sync engine to automatically transform universal commands into each agent's specific format, so that commands work correctly with ClaudeCode (.md), Codex (.md), and GeminiCLI (.toml).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Sync Engine processes a universal command for ClaudeCode THEN it SHALL generate a .md file maintaining the YAML frontmatter and converting `{ARGS}` placeholders to ClaudeCode's expected format.

2. WHEN the Sync Engine processes a universal command for Codex THEN it SHALL generate a .md file converting `{ARGS}` to `$ARGUMENTS` and `{SHELL:cmd}` to `\!cmd` syntax.

3. WHEN the Sync Engine processes a universal command for GeminiCLI THEN it SHALL generate a .toml file with proper sections ([command], [arguments]) and convert `{ARGS}` to `{{args}}` and `{SHELL:cmd}` to `\!{cmd}`.

4. IF a command contains agent-specific features that cannot be transformed THEN the Sync Engine SHALL log a warning and provide best-effort conversion with inline comments marking incompatible sections.

5. WHILE transforming commands with shell execution directives THE Sync Engine SHALL validate and properly escape shell commands for each target agent's security requirements.

### Requirement 3: Deployment Scope Management
**Objective:** As a developer, I want the sync engine to deploy commands to the correct scope (user-level or project-level) for each agent, so that commands are accessible where expected without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying commands to ClaudeCode THEN the Sync Engine SHALL place files in either `~/.claude/commands/` (user-level) or `./.claude/commands/` (project-level) based on the command's scope metadata.

2. WHEN deploying commands to Codex THEN the Sync Engine SHALL place all files in `~/.codex/prompts/` (user-level only) regardless of scope metadata due to Codex's current limitations.

3. WHEN deploying commands to GeminiCLI THEN the Sync Engine SHALL place files in either `~/.gemini/commands/` (user-level) or `./.gemini/commands/` (project-level) with proper namespace mapping (e.g., `git/commit.toml` becomes `git:commit`).

4. IF a deployment directory does not exist THEN the Sync Engine SHALL create the necessary directory structure with appropriate permissions before deploying commands.

5. WHERE existing command files conflict with new deployments THE Sync Engine SHALL create backups with timestamps before overwriting.

### Requirement 4: Third-Party Framework Integration
**Objective:** As a developer using third-party AI frameworks like SuperClaude, I want to import their commands into the unified system, so that these commands become available across all my AI agents without manual copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the setup wrapper script with a third-party framework name THEN the Sync Engine SHALL execute the framework's standard installation command (e.g., `pipx install SuperClaude && SuperClaude install`).

2. IF the third-party framework installation succeeds THEN the Sync Engine SHALL scan the framework's command directory (e.g., `~/.claude/commands/sc/`) for command files.

3. WHEN importing third-party commands THEN the Sync Engine SHALL copy detected command files to a dedicated namespace in the central repository (e.g., `central-commands/_frameworks/superclaude/`).

4. WHERE imported third-party commands use framework-specific syntax THE Sync Engine SHALL attempt best-effort transformation while preserving original files for reference.

5. IF a third-party command cannot be transformed for certain agents THEN the Sync Engine SHALL mark it as partially compatible and document the limitations in metadata.

### Requirement 5: Synchronization Execution and Conflict Resolution
**Objective:** As a developer, I want reliable synchronization that handles conflicts intelligently, so that my command updates propagate safely without losing data or breaking existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer executes the sync command THEN the Sync Engine SHALL process all commands in the central repository and deploy to all configured agents within 60 seconds for typical repositories (<1000 commands).

2. IF file system errors occur during deployment THEN the Sync Engine SHALL roll back changes for the affected agent and report detailed error information.

3. WHILE processing commands with syntax errors THE Sync Engine SHALL continue processing other commands and generate a summary report of all errors at completion.

4. WHEN the sync process completes THEN the Sync Engine SHALL generate a detailed log file with transformation results, deployment paths, and any warnings or errors encountered.

5. IF manual modifications exist in agent-specific directories THEN the Sync Engine SHALL detect these changes and prompt for confirmation before overwriting or merging.

### Requirement 6: Validation and Error Handling
**Objective:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation and clear error messages, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues with command definitions or transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing YAML frontmatter THEN the Sync Engine SHALL validate against a defined schema and report specific validation errors with line numbers.

2. IF command arguments reference undefined variables THEN the Sync Engine SHALL warn about potential runtime errors in the target agent.

3. WHILE validating shell commands THE Sync Engine SHALL check for dangerous patterns (rm -rf, curl | sh) and require explicit confirmation for potentially destructive operations.

4. WHERE transformation produces invalid syntax for target agents THE Sync Engine SHALL generate both the attempted transformation and a diagnostic report explaining the failure.

5. WHEN validation errors prevent synchronization THEN the Sync Engine SHALL provide actionable fix suggestions based on common error patterns.

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization
**Objective:** As a developer with specific workflow needs, I want to configure sync behavior and transformations, so that I can adapt the system to my team's requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a `.sync-config.yaml` file THEN the Sync Engine SHALL read custom transformation rules, path mappings, and agent configurations from this file.

2. IF custom transformation rules are defined THEN the Sync Engine SHALL apply them in addition to or instead of default transformations based on configuration precedence.

3. WHERE developers need to exclude certain commands or directories THE Sync Engine SHALL respect `.syncignore` patterns similar to `.gitignore` syntax.

4. WHEN running in different environments (CI/CD vs local) THEN the Sync Engine SHALL support environment-specific configurations through environment variables or config profiles.

5. IF a developer specifies custom agent paths in configuration THEN the Sync Engine SHALL use these paths instead of default locations for command deployment.

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Reporting
**Objective:** As a developer maintaining multiple commands, I want visibility into sync operations and command usage, so that I can optimize my command library and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sync process runs THEN the Sync Engine SHALL generate both human-readable console output and structured JSON logs for programmatic processing.

2. IF verbose mode is enabled THEN the Sync Engine SHALL output detailed transformation steps, including before/after comparisons for each command.

3. WHILE tracking command changes THE Sync Engine SHALL maintain a history of synchronization operations with timestamps, affected files, and operation results.

4. WHERE performance metrics are collected THE Sync Engine SHALL report synchronization duration, transformation time per command, and I/O statistics.

5. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the Sync Engine SHALL include statistics on total commands processed, successful transformations, warnings, and errors by agent type.
